# Main Ideas
* Energy
	* Berries (small energy increase, but you have a lot of them)
	* Meat (moderate energy increase)
	* MRE-like item (high energy increase but massively increases boredom)
	* Special food item (massively increase energy, decrease thirst & boredom)

* Energy for test of strength which takes X amount of energy based to not get exhausted at the end of the encounter

* Include the appetite descriptions within a value range of 0-100
	* Hunger - 10 - "Starving"

### Enemy encounters

	-Encounter uses energy level and encounter level in formula
	-Encounter levels are random
	-Chance to get special food or toy for pet if encounter is won

1. Easy(1) enemy == 3 turns to survive
	* Health at at least 1/5 to not be exhausted at the end
	* Generic items drop

2. Medium(2) enemy == 6-7 turns to survive
	* Health at at least 2/5 to not be exhausted at the end
	* Above average quality food drops

3. Hard(3) enemy == 10+ turns to survive
	* **Will die** if health is less than 3/5
	* Special food that will give high energy (only from this encounter)
 	* Special toy that will give high happiness (only from this encounter)

### Sleep
* Pet will fall asleep automatically if sleep is less than 10
